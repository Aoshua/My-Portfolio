				<h1>Academic Experience</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>Weber State University</h2>
					<p>I began to attend Weber State University part time when I was
					16 years old, and in 2015 I graduated with my Associate in
					Science degree a week before I graduated from high school. I am
					grateful to WSU for all of the excellent learning opportunities
					it has provided me. I am currently a full-time student studying
					to receive my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. Weber State
					University has phenomenal faculty and staff who truely put forth
					an effort to see their students succeed. </p>
					<p>I am involved in Weber State University’s chapter of American
					Computing Machinery (ACM). Recently, I was elected treasurer.
					This past Easter, we hid plastic eggs in people's yards as a
					fundraiser for our activities. Our activities are geared towards
					giving fellow students in-depth learning opportunities and tours
					of different businesses and organizations within the field of
					technology. These activities help students discover and refine
					their interests, as well as establish connections with
					professionals around the state.</p>
					<p>I also work at Weber State University in its Writing Center as
					a tutor. You will see more information about this on my “Work
					Experience” page. The Writing Center is a place where students
					can come to get help with any form of writing project they have.
					There, tutors help students to improve their grammar,
					organization, and clarity of expression. Students may also receive
					instruction on how to effectively conduct academic research and
					discover their writing style. Working as a tutor in the Writing Center
					has broadened my worldview because I have been able to meet
					various students with different cultures. In this way, the Writing
					Center connects students of all backgrounds with an open and
					friendly environment.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Northern Utah Academy for Math Engineering and Science</h2>
					<p>I graduated with my high school diploma from the Northern Utah
					Academy for Math Engineering and Science (NAUMES). It is this
					early college high school that helped me unveil my passion for
					learning. The excellent teachers and counselors of NUAMES pushed
					me to exceed in all that do. It is because of their partnership
					with Weber State University that I am there today. The teachers
					instilled in me a love for learning and the discipline necessary
					to excel in academia and in my career. My time at NUAMES showed
					me how my choices and my work can truly make a difference in
					society.  </p>
				<br>
				<h2>Additional Learning Opportunities</h2>
					<p>The summer of 2013 I attended a class in computer-aided design
					at the Davis Technical College (DATC). There I expanded upon the
					drafting concepts that I had learned my Sophomore year at NUAMES.</p>
					<p>I have been a member of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) ever
					since I was of age. With BSA I learned many different things,
					from the basics of astronomy to how to spend a night in the
					forest. However, some of the most valuable lessons I learned are
					to serve others, to protect the environment, how to lead and when
					to follow, and the importance of planning. </p>
					<p>Latter-Day Saints in Northern Argentina. This was one the
					greatest learning experience I have ever had. It was a truly unique
					experience to forget about myself for two years and focus on the
					well-being of others. I met many friends, had crazy experiences, and
					saw many miracles that I will not forget. I am thankful to God for
					that time that I had to serve in Argentina, and I recognize His help
					in my studies and in my work. On the mission, I also learned a lot
					about making and sticking to a schedule. I spent a great deal of my
					mission as a zone leader (a missionary who oversees about 20 other
					missionaries). This was a wonderful opportunity for me to sharpen my
					skills of public speaking, management, and planning large events.</p>
