				<h1>Academic Experience</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>Weber State University</h2>
					<p>I began to attend Weber State University part time when 
					I was 16 years old (actual classes, not only concurrent 
					enrollment), and in 2015 I graduated with my Associate in 
					Science degree a week before I graduated from high school. 
					I am grateful to WSU for all of the excellent learning 
					opportunities it has provided me. I am currently a full-time 
					student studying to receive my bachelor’s degree in Computer 
					Science. Weber State University has phenomenal faculty and 
					staff who truely put forth an effort to see their students 
					succeed.</p>
					<p>I am involved in Weber State University’s chapter of 
					American Computing Machinery (ACM). Recently, I was elected 
					treasurer. This past Easter, we hid plastic eggs in peoples’ 
					yards as a fundraiser for our activities. Our activities at 
					are geared towards giving fellow students in-depth learning 
					opportunities and tours of different businesses and 
					organizations within the field of technology. These 
					activities help students discover and refine their interests 
					as well as establish connections with professionals around 
					the state.</p><a id="NUAMES_Link"></a> <!--To jump to this section from left navbar -->
					<p>I also work at Weber State University in its Writing Center,
					as a tutor. You will see more information about this on my 
					“Work Experience” page. The Writing Center is a place where 
					students can come to get help with any form of writing 
					assignment they have. There, tutors help students to improve 
					their grammar, organization, and clarity of expression. 
					Students may also receive instruction on how to effectively 
					conduct research and discover their writing style. Working as
					a tutor in the Writing Center has broadened my worldview 
					because I have been able to meet various students with 
					different cultures. In this way, the Writing Center connects 
					students of all backgrounds with an open and friendly 
					environment.</p>

				<h2>Northern Utah Academy for Math Engineering and Science</h2>
					<p>I graduated with my high school diploma from the Northern
					Utah Academy for Math Engineering and Science (NAUMES). It is 
					this early college high school that helped me unveil my passion 
					for learning. The excellent teachers and counselors of NUAMES 
					pushed me to exceed in all that do. It is because of their 
					partnership with Weber State University that I am there today. The
					teachers instilled in me a love for learning and the 
					discipline necessary to excel in academia and my career. My 
					time at NUAMES showed me how my choices and my work can truly
					make a difference in society.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Additional Learning Opportunities</h2>
					<p>The summer of 2013 I attended a class in computer drafting at 
					the Davis Technical College (DATC). There I expanded upon the 
					drafting concepts that I had learned my Sophomore year at NUAMES.</p>
					<p>I have been a part of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) ever 
					since I was of age. With BSA I learned many different things, 
					from the basics of astronomy to how to spend a night in the 
					forest. However, the some of the most valuable lessons I learned 
					are to serve others, to protect the environment, how to lead and 
					when to follow, and the importance of planning.</p><a id="Assignments_Link"></a> <!--To jump to this section from left navbar -->
					<p>From October 2015 to October 2017 I served as a missionary for
					the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Northern 
					Argentina. Morally, this was one the greatest learning experience
					I have ever had. It was a truly unique experience to forget about
					myself for two years and focus on the well-being of others. I met
					many friends, had crazy experiences, and saw many miracles that I
					will not forget. I am thankful to God for that time that I had to
					serve in Argentina, and I recognize His help in my studies and in
					my work.</p>
