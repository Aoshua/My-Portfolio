				<h1>Work Experience</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>WSU Writing Tutor (November 2017 - Present)</h2>
					<p>I am currently employed as a tutor in the Writing Center of 
					Weber State University. The purpose of the Writing Center is help
					students achieve their potential as writers. As a writing tutor, 
					it is my responsibility to help these students gain a better 
					understanding of the writing process through one-on-one teaching.
					This is a job that I thoroughly enjoy because I am able to see 
					issues through from start to finish. Students will enter a session
					with questions and concerns about their writing projects. However,
					by the end of a session, the studentsâ€™ questions are resolved, 
					and they leave with a greater sense of what to do next in their 
					projects. </p>
				<br>
				
				<h2>UPS (November 2017 - January 2018)</h2>
					<p>I worked as a seasonal package handler at UPS during their 
					busiest time of year: Christmas. My job at UPS was very fast 
					paced and physically extraneous. Package handlers, such as myself,
					must assess packages coming down several belts in order to 
					properly load them into various trucks and trailers. I was in a 
					section where a companion and I typically loaded eight separate 
					trailers. This required quick thinking: to read the labels, 
					speedily get (sometimes rather large) packages to the trailers, 
					and then stack them in a Tetris-like manner.  I typically worked 
					there from 12:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Some days of the week, I finished 
					up there and then went to the Writing Center to work for a few more 
					hours. This shows my dedication to my responsibilities and my 
					relentless work ethic.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h2>Subway (June 2014 - 2014)</h2>
					<p>One of my first jobs was at Subway. Here I worked as a Sandwich
					Artist, and was quickly promoted to Shift Manager. The Shift 
					Manager has all of the responsibilities of a Sandwich Artist and 
					more. My responsibilities were customer service, food preparation,
					custodial duties, balance the register, and to open/close the 
					restaurant. This was a great first job for me as I was able to 
					learn about the importance of working in a team. </p>
