				<h2>WSU Writing Tutor (November 2017 - Present)</h2> <a id="UPS_Link"></a> <!-- This is intentionally in a funky spot so that it jumps to the correct position since the nav bar obstructs the view -->
					<p>I am currently employed at the Writing Center of WSU as a writing tutor. The goal 
					of the Writing Center is mold students into better writers. As a writing tutor, it 
					is my responsibility to help these students along the writing process, with one-on-one 
					teaching techniques. This is a job that I thoroughly enjoy because I am able to see 
					issues through from start to finish. Student will enter a session feeling lost with 
					troubling grammatical or logical concerns in their writing projects. However, by the 
					end of a session, the studentsâ€™ questions are resolved, and they leave with a greater 
					sense of what to do next in their projects.</p>

				<h2>UPS (November 2017 - January 2018)</h2><a id="Subway_Link"></a> <!--To jump to this section from left navbar -->
					<p>I worked as a seasonal package handler at UPS during their busy time of year: Christmas. 
					My job at UPS was very fast paced and physically extraneous. Package handlers, such as 
					myself, must assess packages coming down several belts in order to properly load them into
					various trucks and trailers. I was in a section were a companion and I typically loaded eight 
					separate trailers. This required quick thinking to read the labels, speedily get (sometimes 
					rather large) packages to the trailers, and then stack them in a Tetris-like manner.  I 
					typically worked there from 1:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Some days of the week, I finished up there 
					and then went to the Writing Center to work for a few more hours. This shows my dedication 
					to my responsibilities and my relentless work ethic.</p>
				<br>
				
				<h2>Subway (June 2014 - 2014)</h2><a id="Tech_Knowledge_Link"></a> <!--To jump to this section from left navbar -->
					<p>One of my first jobs was at Subway. Here I worked as a Sandwich Artist, and was quickly 
					promoted to Shift Manager. The Shift Manager has all of the responsibilities of a Sandwich
					Artist and more. My responsibilities were customer service, food preparation, custodial 
					duties, balance the register, and to open/close the restaurant.</p>
